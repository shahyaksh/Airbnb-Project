# Airbnb Property Search Bot

**Team members: Yaksh Shah, Smit Chandi.**

 The real estate industry has undergone significant advancements with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) into property search systems. Traditional keyword-based search engines often struggle to understand user intent, limiting their effectiveness for descriptive or nuanced queries. Inspired by Zillow’s NLP-powered search engine, which allows users to search properties using natural language, this project aims to create an intelligent recommendation system for Airbnb listings.

## Dataset Information

We collected property data for nearly 69,000 Airbnb listings belonging to four major cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and San Diego. The data was obtained from a third-party website. The dataset includes a comprehensive set of features for each listing, covering various aspects such as property details, host information, pricing,availability, and review scores. Check out the data [here](https://insideairbnb.com/explore/)

### Preprocessing

1. **Feature Selection**:
   - There were about 56 features in the dataset but we considered only 31 which were actually usefull for 
1. **Text Cleaning:**
   - Removal of HTML tags from text columns using regex (`<.*?>`).
   - Removal of non-alphanumeric characters while preserving punctuation.
   - Conversion of non-string data types (e.g., lists or numbers) into strings.

2. **Data Type Handling:**
   - Ensures proper handling of `date` and `datetime` objects without altering their values.
   - Converts lists to space-separated strings for compatibility in text-based operations.

## Application Architecture

**Key Features**:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Users can describe their ideal property (e.g., "a cozy apartment in San Diego with 2 bedrooms under $200") in natural language, and the bot interprets the query accurately.

- **Hybrid Search with Pinecone**: Integrated a hybrid retrieval system using:
   - Dense embeddings generated by `sentence-transformers/multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` for semantic similarity.
   - Sparse retrieval with BM25 for enhanced relevance in keyword matching.

- **Metadata Filtering**: Leveraged Pinecone's metadata filtering to refine search results based on price, location, amenities, and more.

- **Generative AI**: Used Google's Gemini model to generate property descriptions and refine user queries dynamically.

- **Streamlit Interface**: Built a user-friendly interface with Streamlit for real-time chatbot interactions and displaying property results.
  
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualizes Airbnb data for trend analysis and actionable insights.Includes search filters, metrics, and performance analysis.

# **Impact of the Airbnb Property Search Bot**

The Airbnb Property Search Bot revolutionizes how users find accommodations by leveraging AI to deliver highly personalized and efficient search experiences. Here's its specific impact:

1. **Time Efficiency**:  
   Eliminates the need for users to sift through endless listings manually. By interpreting natural language descriptions, the bot quickly narrows down options that fit the user's unique preferences.

2. **Personalized Recommendations**:  
   Provides tailored property suggestions by understanding context and intent behind user queries, ensuring each recommendation aligns with specific needs such as budget, location, amenities, and accommodation size.

3. **Enhanced Search Experience**:  
   Uses hybrid search techniques—combining syntactic precision and semantic understanding—to offer results that are both accurate and contextually relevant.

4. **Dynamic Query Refinement**:  
   Supports iterative searches by refining recommendations based on user-provided updates, allowing seamless adjustments to preferences without restarting the process.

5. **Accessibility**:  
   Simplifies the Airbnb search process for a broad audience, including those unfamiliar with filtering tools, by enabling natural language interactions.

The bot not only enhances the user experience but also demonstrates the potential of conversational AI in redefining search paradigms for real-world applications, making property discovery intuitive and engaging.

## Challenges and Future Directions

### Challenges
1. ** Garbage in Garbage Out**:
   - The results will not be proper if proper description is not provided.
2. **Metadata**:
   - Some of the metadata of properties are not accurate due to some error while generation of description or during collection of the data so, some results will have metadata different from what it is in the     property description.

### Future Directions

1. **Add more listings**:
   - Add more listings considering other locations too.
2. **Handle Metadata Inaccuracies**:
   - Experiment with different prompt and see the results if it produces better metadata for a particular property description or not.
